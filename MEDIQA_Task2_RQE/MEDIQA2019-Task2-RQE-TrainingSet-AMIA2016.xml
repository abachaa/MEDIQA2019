   32-year-old man with shortness of breath on exertion, supposedly has Type 2 diabetes, has family history of cardiomyopathy.  The question is how to address this issue.  Is he having hypertensive cardiomyopathy?  Is he having familial cardiomyopathy?  And which antihypertensive would be best?  Should I give a beta blocker because of the possible hypertensive cardiomyopathy?  Should I give an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor because of the diabetes?  Or what?
