Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in [DATE] 2015.  Does the term &apos;congenital&apos; mean that it could be passed down to another generation?

Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in [DATE] 2015.  Does the term &apos;congenital&apos; mean that it could be passed down to another generation?
